                  I'm Bruno, a Software Engineer based in San Francisco, CA. In
                  early 2019, I made a career change from being in the emergency
                  medical field to becoming an engineer. That's when I decided
                  to join a coding bootcamp in San Francisco. Since my bootcamp,
                  I have gained great real world experience through two
                  internships. During my time with the Moringa Fellowship as
                  well as Esports Development League, I was able to take charge
                  and be responsible for the frontend. Although most of my
                  experience in my internships has been in the frontend, Iâ€™m
                  super comfortable jumping anywhere in the stack.

                  When I'm not being a nerd infront of my computer, I tend to
                  spend most of my free time being a dad to my baby of six
                  months. Even though daddy duties are full time work, I try to
                  sneak in some time for playing a bit of League of Legends.
                  Ever since the pandemic hit, my wife and I have started to
                  binge watch a lot of shows to pass the time. Some of my
                  favorites are "Hell's Kitchen", "The Simpsons", and "The King
                  of Queens". Ohh and Sundays are for football, go{" "}
