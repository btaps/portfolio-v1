                  Hi! I'm Bruno. One of the carziest things I've ever done was
                  make a career change which led me here. In early 2019, I
                  decided to change careers from being in the emergency medical
                  field to becoming a engineer. That's when I decided to join a
                  coding bootcamp in San Francisco. Since my bootcamp, I have
                  gained great real world experience through two internships.
                  During my time with the Moringa Fellowship as well as Esports
                  Development League, I was able to take charge and be
                  responsible for the frontend. Although most of my experience
                  in my internships has been in the frontend, Iâ€™m super
                  comfortable jumping anywhere in the stack if needed.

                  Well, when I'm not being a nerd infront of my computer, I tend
                  to spend most of my free time being a dad to my baby of six
                  months. Even though daddy duties are full time work, I try to
                  sneak in some time for playing a bit of League of Legends.
                  Mostly when the baby is sleeping or we have a baby sitter.
                  Ever since the pandemic hit, my wife and I have started to
                  binge watch a lot of shows to pass the time. Some of my
                  favorites are "Hell's Kitchen", "The Simpsons", and "The King
                  of Queens". Ohh and Sundays are for football, go{" "}
